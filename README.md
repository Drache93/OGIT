# Welcome to the _Open Graph of IT_ Ontology

## Overview

_Open Graph of IT_ aims to build a semantic representation of all IT and its interaction with business processes and people. 

Such an endeavour requires a sound data space as a foundation for computational evaluation of this enterprise space. 

_Open Graph of IT_ aims to become the 'IT version' of **Google's Knowledge Graph** or Facebook's **Social Graph**.

Hence we need a common language for IT entities and relationships between them.

The _OGIT ontology project_ targets to provide a such common language by defining an ontology for the _Graph of IT_.

_OGIT ontology project_ is not only hosting place for a specification. It also
 provides a platform for domain experts to contribute to the ontology. 
One of the basic principles is: _evolution over standardization_

Furthermore this is not just an ontology specification.

**This is real!**

There is an application called _GraphIT_ that allows to manage IT data through a RESTful API ensuring compliance to _OGIT ontology_

Throughout the docs we often use _OGIT_ as a shortcut for both _Open Graph of IT_ and _Open Graph of IT ontology_.
