    dcterms:description "Service tasks are those done by software. These are program functions applied automatically as a process executes. BPMN normally assumes that this function is provided as web service, though it can be another implementation. The service task is a component of process-oriented implementation integration, which explains why it is so similar in concept to Service-OrientedArchitecture (SOA). Typical examples from the world of implementation integration are: The credit rating provided by a rating agency, obtained as XML through HTTP during a credit check.";
