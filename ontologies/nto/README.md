## Cost

All elements for the cost model are in the Cost NTO and can be found in OGIT under „ogit/Cost“.

The cost model defines the cost structure of a vendor through a hierarchy of cost elements.

Planning templates describe assumptions about how many instances of a certain service with a certain parameterization the vendor will have to operate. Applying a price function to the cost model yields the price model.

#### Cost element for a Service

There are three levels of cost elements:

* Top level, e.g. „Microsoft for MicProject in EU“
* Middle level, e.g. „OS Hosting“, „CPU“, „Memory“
* Bottom level, e.g. „HR“, „Licensing“, „Housing“, „Depreciation“

Between the different levels, for each cost element there could be two types of edges:

* Incoming
* outgoing

Each type of edge could have two types of connections:

* consistsOf
* contributesTo

A service, e.g. DBHosting has associated to it different types of costs. Let’s call each one of them a cost element.

Each cost element could have an incoming  and an outgoing edge, which connects it to another cost element and contains it’s weight indicating how much it contributes/consists in relation to another cost element.

E.g.: from the picture below we can understand that the CPU cost is consisting in 30% of HR cost. 5% of the HR cost contribute to the CPU costs.

Since currently in OGIT there are no edges with weights, the following approach to represent it through entities was taken:

#### Cost Model Ontology

Each service offering is to be offered for a service with attributes defined for certain values or ranges. E.g.: price defined for Memory of size 14188 – 1572864.

Within one order, it could be specified the ordering of a service with attributes containing the concrete values of a range.

An implementation template consists of some interconnected MARS-Nodes.

Together with the values specified by the offering and the order it becomes a concrete implementation.

A *Planning Template* is an estimated planning of cost elements referring to:

- A.	an Implementation Template,
- B.	Planning Parameter with estimated average parameters for an order and concrete value of a parameter for an Offering and the planned number of service instances (volume attribute of entity PlanningTemplate.
- C.	A PlanningTemplate will consist of a recursive set of sub-templates, connected through the edge has, where each one of them will represent a service.

As there could be some services that don’t have any parameters, the additional edge plansCostFor from PlanningTemplate to Service is required.

A Planning Parameter will contain a concrete value of a Parameter and the statistics derived from the expected distribution as attributes.

## Forum

This NTO is pertains to generic web forum / social media. Heavily utilised by [TabTab](https://tabtab.co/)

## Statistics

Elements for the autopilot statistics are grouped under the stats NTO and can be found in OGIT under "ogit/stats".

## UserMeta

This NTO pertains to generic meta around an ogit/Person. Initially used for Game Meta in aragoId
